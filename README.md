### When we looked at it in detail, it was all about learning about some programming languages, how computers were created, as well as how to use a text calculator and store information. It was truly amazing, and I wish I could continue to pursue this line of work as a career rather than just for fun.

## An electronic hardware or software tool called a calculator is used to perform mathematical operations like addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division.

### A computer can store data either temporarily or permanently using this mechanism. Most digital devices need storage components like flash drives and hard disks because they let users store all kinds of data, including videos, documents, pictures, and raw data.
