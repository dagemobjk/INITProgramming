# the main point of todays topic 
### When we looked at it in detail, it was all about learning about some programming languages, how computers were created, as well as how to use a text calculator and store information. It was truly amazing, and I wish I could continue to pursue this line of work as a career rather than just for fun.

## what is external HDDS and SSD
       
### A simple external hard drive or SSD is a component that you plug into your computer to almost immediately add more storage space without having to access your computer's internal storage and perform upgrades.
